# miniprojekti Matkahaku
## This project is a part of Academic Work Academy's Full stack Java course.
After four weeks of intensive training we got couple of days to do a project. Our goal was to fetch JSON formatted data from digitraffic.fi.
It is a state-owned information service which provides all kinds of railroad data.
There is also little authentication feature which can remember user's last queries, but it saves the data only to browser's memory. So if you close the browser, they will disappear. 

You can also find mapview called "Kartta asemista" where you see your own location and all locations of trainstops/railwaystations. This feature will give you an idea where the nearest railwaystation is. 

In the "Galleria"-section you can get influenced by beautiful train-related photos.

From "Tietoa tekijöistä" section you can find information about our dev team.

Technologies that are used in this project are:
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS / Bootstrap

##### Hope you enjoy it!
